# Alghoritms_In_Kotlin
This is my library which provides some basic alghoritms implementations, and solved LeetCode Tasks on Kotlin, all is covered by Unit Tests

I configured here static analyzer : detekt

Covered by Unit tests using: Kotest, JUnit4, JUnit5

Implemented:
            <p>- BOGO Sort O(n* n!)</p>
            <p>- Radix Sort O(n* k)</p>
            <p>- Heap Sort O(n*log2 n)</p>

also implemented
<p>- Thread safe implementation of singleton and tested it using RxJava, ThreadPool, Coroutines, Flows, Channels, ReentrantLock and another ways</p>
<p>- enum class based on singleton and covered it by tests</p>
